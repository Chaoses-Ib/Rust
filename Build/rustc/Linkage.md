## `staticlib`

[â†’CXX](/Language/FFI.md#cxx)

What if the library links other C libraries?
- At leasy it's possible to bundle them yourself.
  
  [linux - How to merge two "ar" static libraries into one? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3821916/how-to-merge-two-ar-static-libraries-into-one)

- They are bundled. The filenames in the final `.lib` are absolute paths to the `.obj` files, instead of `{crate}-{hash1}.{crate}.{hash2}-cgu-{n}-rcgu.o`.

  The header files may be found at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\registry\src\index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f\foo-sys-0.1.0\include`.

  Cargo is nearly a C++ package manager.

      - Warning: structure field / method `MyFunc` should have a snake case name
        ```rust
        #[allow(non_snake_case)]
        #[derive(WrapperApi)]
        struct Api {
            #[allow(non_snake_case)]
            MyFunc: ...
        }
        ```
        `#[allow(non_snake_case)] struct Api` is not enough.
