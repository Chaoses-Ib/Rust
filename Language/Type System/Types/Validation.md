  > This crate is heavily inspired by the [validator](https://github.com/Keats/validator) crate. It is essentially a full rewrite of `validator`. The creation of this crate was prompted by [this comment](https://github.com/Keats/validator/issues/201#issuecomment-1167018511) and a few others talking about a potential rewrite.

  > The major differences are:
  > 
  > * Validation rules are traits, so they may be implemented for custom types. ([Use traits for validation rules #205](https://github.com/Keats/validator/issues/205))
  > * The generated trait accepts a `Context` type, which is passed to each `custom` validator. This allows arbitrary customization to the validation process, and it opens the space up for use-cases like localization of error messages.
  > * The derive macro supports enums. ([Support enum #77](https://github.com/Keats/validator/issues/77))
  > * Added `Valid<T>` and `Unvalidated<T>`, which implement the typestate pattern. ([Enforce validation with typestate #185](https://github.com/Keats/validator/issues/185))
  >   `Unvalidated` may be created from arbitrary values, but the only way to create `Valid` is to call `validate` on `Unvalidated`. `Unvalidated` also implements `serde::Deserialize`, so it may be used in [integrations with web frameworks](https://github.com/jprochazk/garde/issues/12).
  > * Rules are responsible for generating error messages, and the resulting errors do not receive params afterwards. This means that `sensitive` should no longer be necessary, but I might also be totally wrong about this approach, not sure about this!

  > [Lots of remaining work to do](https://github.com/jprochazk/garde/milestone/1), but as far as I can tell, the only features which are missing for feature parity with `validator` are the `nested` and `required` rules. I'm really interested in seeing what people think!
