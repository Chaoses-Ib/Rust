# Data Structures
- [heapless: Heapless, `static` friendly data structures](https://github.com/japaric/heapless)

## Arrays
- [Syncbuf: A small library of append-only, thread-safe, lock-free data structures.](https://github.com/bplevin36/syncbuf)

  Can `push` with `&self`, but cannot mutate items.

### Vectors
- [rust-smallvec: "Small vector" optimization for Rust: store up to a small number of items on the stack](https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec)
- [tinyvec: Just, really the littlest Vec you could need. So smol.](https://github.com/Lokathor/tinyvec)

- [Dup-Indexer: Create a non-duplicated index from Strings, static str, Vec, or Box values](https://github.com/nyurik/dup-indexer)

### Segment vectors
- [segvec: SegVec data structure for rust. Similar to Vec, but allocates memory in chunks of increasing size.](https://github.com/mccolljr/segvec/)

- [typed-arena: The arena, a fast but limited type of allocator](https://github.com/thomcc/rust-typed-arena)

  Can `alloc` with `&self`, and returns `&mut T`.

- [boxcar: A concurrent, append-only vector.](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/boxcar)

  Can `push` with `&self`.

- [aovec: Append-only concurrent vector](https://docs.rs/aovec/latest/aovec/)

  Can `push` with `&self`, but cannot mutate items.
