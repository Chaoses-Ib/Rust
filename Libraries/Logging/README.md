# Logging
- [log: Logging implementation for Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/log)

  ```rust
  #[macro_use(trace, info, debug, warn, error)]
  extern crate log;
  ```

  The evaluation of arguments is lazy.

## Testing
[^log-test]

- Macro aliasing
  ```rust
  #[cfg(not(test))] 
  use log::{error, warn, info, debug, trace};

  #[cfg(test)]
  use std::{eprintln as error, eprintln as warn, eprintln as info, eprintln as debug, eprintln as trace};
  ```
  Not compatible with `tracing`.

- [test-log: A replacement of the `#[test]` attribute that initializes logging and/or tracing infrastructure before running tests.](https://github.com/d-e-s-o/test-log)

  ```rust
  #[cfg(test)]
  #[macro_use(test)]
  extern crate test_log;
  ```

  When used with `tracing`, requries `tracing-subscriber` with `env-filter` feature enabled.

- [tracing-test: Access and evaluate tracing logs in async and sync tests.](https://github.com/dbrgn/tracing-test)
