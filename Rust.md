> 如果对 C++ 很熟的话，一天上手问题不大，所有权那部分 C++ 有移动语义对应，泛型就是个退化的模板，唯一可能头疼点的就是 concurrency 那块了，Send 和 Sync 要理解一下，async/await 在 C++20 里才有，没用过的话也要适应下。

## Cons
- The curse of complexity
  
  > Worse is better，语言的流行需要的是简单，不是“好”。

- > The point is to indicate *thematic divergence*. The priorities I had while working on the language are broadly not the revealed priorities of the community that's developed around the language in the years since, or even that were being-revealed in the years during. **I would have traded performance and expressivity away for simplicity** -- both end-user cognitive load and implementation simplicity in the compiler -- and by doing so I would have taken the language in a direction *broadly* opposed to where a lot of people wanted it to go.

  > I don't think Graydon was about to reinvent Go, no. But the ideas he advocates for here - minimizing user- and implementer-facing complexity, actors/green threads, a fixed set of built-in containers, more support for dynamic dispatch, some acceptance for nonzero-cost abstractions - are all found in Go too.
